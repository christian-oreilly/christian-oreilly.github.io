description: "This project aims to develop a more principled approach to the study of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) from electrocardiograms (ECG). We expect to improve our understanding of the impact of ASD on ANS physiology by more accurately modeling the cardiac processes. We will achieve this objective by injecting in our analyses prior knowledge captured by 1) the model structure and 2) prior distributions for model parameters. Specific we aim to 1) formulate and validate a heart model simulating the heart response to an input control signal representing the ANS tonus (forward modeling); 2) implement Bayesian inference of model parameters and control signals from ECG recordings (inverse modeling); and develop and compare across clinical groups growth curves describing the evolution of model parameters (growth curves)."
