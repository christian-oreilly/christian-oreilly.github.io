description: "This proposal will directly examine the role of released ACh in regulating BLa circuits and emotional behaviors. Aim 1. To determine the circuit mechanism by which synaptic acetylcholine modulates local BLa oscillations. Aim 2: To determine the mechanism by which ACh acts on the BLa circuit to regulate fear learning. Aim 3: To determine the circuit mechanism by which ACh regulates fear discrimination."
