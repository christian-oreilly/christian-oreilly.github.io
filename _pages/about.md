The Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience Analyses (LINA) was founded in 2022 by Christian O'Reilly, shortly after he moved to the [University of South Carolina (UofSC)](https://sc.edu/), as a way to consolidate the identity of his research group and promote a model-driven approach to the study of neuroscience. It is located within the [Artificial Intelligence Institute of South Carolina (AIISC)](https://aiisc.ai/).

Mission statement
======
The overarching research objective at LINA is to develop principled, model-driven approaches for multi-scale analysis of the brain to better understand this organ across spatial and temporal scales and address complex neurodevelopmental issues such as autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We believe in a collaborative and open science and harness the highly expressive and powerfully featured Python ecosystem to deploy accessible and agile software. We use different methodological approaches, including analytical techniques (e.g., EEG source reconstruction, functional connectivity) and modeling (e.g., point neurons, morphologically-detailed neurons, neural masses), as well as the combination of these two approaches through Bayesian model-driven analyses. Computational neuroscience is a central element of our toolkit and we aim to contribute to the development of a critical mass of expertise in that area in South Carolina. Further, through our embedding within the AIISC and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the UofSC, we also seek to develop novel ways to empower the study of neuroscience through AI and to empower AI through biologically inspired neural networks.
